# RandomForest_AlphaThal
This respiratory contains code to detect deletions in the alpha thalassemia region by using random forest classifiers.

The focus of this project was to use random forest classifiers to analyze large deletions in the alpha thalassemia region from short sequence reads.  

The ‘RanFor_Graphing.py’ file plots how model accuracy reacts to model complexity and coverage per sample to examine if the model is overfitting.  
The ‘RanFor_RealData.py’ file analyzes how well real data performs on a model created from simulated data by displaying genotype and genotype probability 
    outputs.  

The code was written by Jennifer Lin, a 2022 summer intern working with Dr. Nancy F. Hansen and Dr. James C. Mullikin in the NHGRI branch at 
    the National Institute of Health.  Jennifer Lin can be reached at jcrylin@gmail.com.
